🔹 MODULE 12: DBMS Architecture, Security & NoSQL (Awareness)

Goal: High-level internal + real-world awareness

2-Tier vs 3-Tier Architecture
2-Tier

Client ↔ Database
(Simple, less scalable)

3-Tier

Client ↔ Application ↔ Database
(Most modern applications)

Schema Architecture (3-Level)
External Schema

User views

Conceptual Schema

Logical structure

Internal Schema

Physical storage

📌 Helps in data independence.

Data Independence
Logical

Change schema without affecting users

Physical

Change storage without affecting schema

Security Basics
User Roles

Control access (read, write, admin)

SQL Injection (Concept)

Malicious SQL via user input

Prevented using prepared statements

SQL vs NoSQL (Very Basic)
SQL	NoSQL
Fixed schema	Flexible schema
Tables	Documents / key-value
Strong consistency	High scalability
MySQL vs MongoDB

MySQL → relational, structured

MongoDB → NoSQL, document-based
